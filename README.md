### Titles & Subtitles 
 
The `<TitleText>` tag should only include the title. Titles are displayed on our site as they are
submitted in the `<TitleText>`. There are separate tags for subtitle, series information, edition,
and author name - proper use of tags means better discovery on our site. 

   **Best Practices for Title and Subtitle**
   
• Don't include series information in the title - that's what the `<series>` or `<collection>`
composites are for!</br>
• Use the `<subtitle>` tag instead of including the subtitle as part of the main title</br>
• Don't invert titles so that articles are at the end. (e.g. Shark in the Park, The.)</br>
• Don't include the author's name in the title.</br>
• Title and Subtitle have a limit of 250 characters each, including spaces.</br>

### Publishing Status

**ONIX**

Publishing Status is a simple yet powerful tag in ONIX: it is the composite that can activate or
deactivate a title without manual intervention.
At Kobo, a value of 02 (Forthcoming) or 04 (Active) will activate a title, provided that its
Activation Date is in the past. Any other value will deactivate the title (remove the title from
sale), so we encourage you to review and update your catalogue, paying special attention to
any titles with value 00 (Unspecified).
It’s important to note that Publishing Status is required in ONIX 3.0. And while it’s not required
in ONIX 2.1 it is considered the best practice to include it.


</br>`<PublishingStatus>04</PublishingStatus>`
or
`<b394>04</b394>`</br>

**Excel**

In our excel template, we use column A: Publishing Status. A title will be available for sale or
preorder by using the value active. To remove your title from sale, simply use the value
deactivated.
